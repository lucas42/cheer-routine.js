 * An object representing a point in spacetime.  This includes position in Euclidean Space as well as time.  Note: units are NOT SI, there are in cheerleading units:
 * x: The distance across the mat someone is located.  In units of 6 feet (the width of one strip of standard cheerleading mat).  Standard mats go from 0 (Stage left) to 9 (Stage right).
 * y: The distance down the mat someone is located.  In units of 6 feet.  Standard mats go from 0 (Upstage) to 7 (Downstage).
 * z: How far in the air someone is.  A guide to levels is: 0 - on the floor, 1 - smoosh, 2 - prep, 3 - extention
 * bar: How many bars into the routine the time point is at.  Usually routines start at bar 1, but there can be a intro during bar 0 (often not a full bar)
 * beat: How many beats into the bar the time point is at.
 *
 * @param {object} rawdata An object containing the above properties
